# EmojiChess

EmojiChess is a chess variant that has multiple different 'civilisations'. Each player
plays with a random civilisation. Of course, each civilisation has different pieces
that can move and/or capture differently. 

This repository hosts the source code for my EmojiChess website. 

Currently one can only play against Stuckfish (currently the only EmojiChess engine on the market)
but as you can see in the code I'm working on making people able to play against each other and 
adding a league system.
