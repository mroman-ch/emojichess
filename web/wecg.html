EmojiChess - WECG
</header>
<main>
<h1>WECG</h1>
<p>
The WECG (World EmojiChess Group) hosts the WW-ECL. 
</p>
<h2>The WW-ECL</h2>
<p>
The WW-ECL is divided into separate divisions from lowest to highest skilled players. 
</p>
<table class="rule">
<tr class="emoji"><td>&#x1F4A9;</td><td>&#x1F921;</td><td>&#x1F9E6;</td><td>&#x1F4A1;</td><td>&#x1F48E;</td><td>&#x1F451;</td><td>&#x1F607;</td></tr>
<tr><td>Poo Division</td><td>Clown Divison</td><td>Socks Division</td><td>Lightbulb Division</td><td>Jewel Division</td><td>Crown Division</td><td>Master Division</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
If a player has a winrate of &gt;=75% over the past 12 games then the player will advance to the 
next higher division. If a player has a winrate of &lt;=25% over the past 12 games then the player will 
drop back to the next lower division. New players start in the Clown Division. If at the end of a period
a division has too few players in it a few of the top players of the next lower division will advance 
to that division. This is to avoid the following scenario: Let's say some very good players join
and are placed in the Clown Division. They are all very good but since they are all in the same division 
and have around the same skill it might be that none of them achieves a 75% winrate and thus are stuck
in the Clown Division and don't properly spread out to higher divisions. 
</p>
<p>
If the WECG decides that there's enough evidence to assume that a player is guilty of fraud (cheating,
abusing multiple accounts, ...) then the WECG will take appropriate actions such as deleting the player's
accounts. 
</p>
<h2>Titles</h2>
<p>
If a player has been in the Master Division for 3 seasons then the WECG will award that player the 
ECM (EmojiChess Master) title. There's also an HECP (Honorary EmojiChess Player) title that is awarded
to players that have contributed greatly to EmojiChess or the EmojiChess community or have done other outstanding
things worthy of that title. 
</p>
<h3>HECP</h3>
<p>
If somebody were to design OTB pieces for the civilizations such that they can be 3d printed
or similar then that's certainly worthy of an HECP title!
